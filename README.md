Voting Contract
Demo smart contract to illustrate how voting may work on the blockchain
Process
1. First in the constructor, we provide proposal names and voters list (voters address).
2. The voter has the option to delegate their vote to someone they trust using the delegate() function.
3. Then the voter can vote using the vote() function.
4. Finally we can check the winner proposal who got the most votes using the winnerName() function.
